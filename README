`functorrent' is a bittorrent client.

building
--------

I suggest using cabal sandbox.

Steps:

1. cabal sandbox init
2. cabal install --only-dependencies
3. cabal build # binaries in ./dist/built/functorrent/*

Goals
-----

- Become more profient with Haskell.
- Implement something non-trivial with Haskell (crypto, file operations, network
  operations, concurrency, bit twiddling, DHT).
- Follow the spec - https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification
- Easy for newbies like me to read and understand along side the spec.
- doctest and quickcheck tests.
- Follow Haskell Style Guide - https://github.com/tibbe/haskell-style-guide/blob/master/haskell-style.md

Status
------

- decode torrent files (bencoding)
- talk to the tracker and get the peer list

TODO
----

- Peer protocol.
- Get the file download working in the simplest possible way.
- Concurrency (threads per peer)
- other advanced features of Bit Torrent (like DHT).
