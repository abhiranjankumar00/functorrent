From WordNet (r) 3.0 (2006) [wn]:

  deluge
      n 1: an overwhelming number or amount; "a flood of requests"; "a
           torrent of abuse" [syn: {flood}, {inundation}, {deluge},
           {torrent}]
      2: a heavy rain [syn: {downpour}, {cloudburst}, {deluge},
         {waterspout}, {torrent}, {pelter}, {soaker}]
      3: the rising of a body of water and its overflowing onto
         normally dry land; "plains fertilized by annual inundations"
         [syn: {flood}, {inundation}, {deluge}, {alluvion}]
      v 1: fill quickly beyond capacity; as with a liquid; "the
           basement was inundated after the storm"; "The images
           flooded his mind" [syn: {deluge}, {flood}, {inundate},
           {swamp}]
      2: charge someone with too many tasks [syn: {overwhelm},
         {deluge}, {flood out}]
      3: fill or cover completely, usually with water [syn:
         {inundate}, {deluge}, {submerge}]

`deluge' is a bittorrent client.

building
--------

I suggest using cabal sandbox.

Steps:

1. cabal sandbox init
2. cabal install --only-dependencies
3. cabal build # binaries in ./dist/built/deluge/*

Goals
-----

- Become more profient with Haskell.
- Implement something non-trivial with Haskell (crypto, file operations, network
  operations, concurrency, bit twiddling, DHT).
- Spec compliance.
- Easy for newbies like me to read and understand along side the spec.
- doctest and quickcheck tests.

Status
------

- decode torrent files (bencoding)
- talk to the tracker and get the peer list

TODO
----

- Peer protocol.
- Get the file download working in the simplest possible way.
- Concurrency (threads per peer)
- other advanced features of Bit Torrent (like DHT).
